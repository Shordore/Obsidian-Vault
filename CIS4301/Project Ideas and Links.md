Health QOL:
Not the best data set but has a lot of interesting information divided by state. Am not sure how to make it fit the project restrictions however.

*Maybe superimpose health social programs by state and overall health in state?*

General life QOL:

This is a country level dataset of QOL in different countries. We probably are looking for more state level rather than country, but I thought it was interesting nonetheless.

Library Locations USA:

This is a fantastic data set with over 191,000 rows of libraries ranging from 1992-2012. It gives so much information such as grants for each library and the funding from each, local, state, and federal level. It also shows the population of each town the library resides in, and the state.
