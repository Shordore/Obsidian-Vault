**Overview**

  

This PowerPoint, presented in a CIS 4301 course by Mohammad Al‑Saad, introduces the theory and practical aspects of **functional dependencies (FDs)** in relational databases. The presentation covers fundamental definitions, illustrative examples, and key rules for reasoning about FDs, leading into more complex topics like computing closures, applying Armstrong’s Axioms, and deriving minimal bases. It also ties these concepts into the normalization process used to design database schemas.

**Key Topics Covered**

• **Definitions & Examples:**

The slides introduce the concept of a functional dependency (FD) with several definitions and multiple examples. They explain scenarios with both single and multiple attributes on either side of the dependency.

• **Keys and Superkeys:**

The presentation explains how FDs relate to keys—attributes or sets of attributes that uniquely identify records in a database—and how superkeys (which may contain redundant attributes) are identified.

• **Rules for FD Reasoning:**

A set of rules is presented for manipulating and inferring FDs. These include:

• **Splitting/Combining:** How to break or merge dependencies.

• **Trivial Attribute Closure:** Understanding when an FD is inherently true.

• **Transitivity and Closure:** Methods to deduce additional FDs from a given set.

• **Projection:** How to determine which FDs hold when a schema is reduced to a subset of its attributes.

• **Armstrong’s Axioms:**

These are the foundational rules (reflexivity, augmentation, and transitivity) used to derive all FDs from a given set.

• **Attribute Closure (Y⁺):**

A practical method is provided to compute the closure of a set of attributes, which is crucial for testing whether a set of attributes forms a superkey and for inferring all the FDs that follow from a given set.

• **Finding All Implied FDs and Minimal Basis:**

The presentation outlines an algorithm that:

• Computes the closure for every subset of attributes.

• Identifies nontrivial FDs (where the right side is not a subset of the left).

• Removes redundant dependencies by dropping those that can be inferred from simpler ones.

This process eventually leads to a minimal (or canonical) set of FDs that still fully describes the dependency relationships in the schema.

• **Normalization:**

A motivating example is provided where a relation (like ABCD with FDs such as AB → C, C → D, and D → A) is decomposed into smaller relations (e.g., ABC and AD). This demonstrates how inferred FDs help determine the correct decomposition to eliminate redundancy and maintain data integrity.

**Breaking Down the Hard Concepts**

1. **Functional Dependencies (FDs):**

• **What It Means:** An FD X → Y indicates that if two rows agree on the attributes X, they must also agree on the attributes Y.

• **Challenge:** Grasping how FDs enforce consistency and integrity in database design.

2. **Attribute Closure (Y⁺):**

• **Definition:** The closure of a set Y, denoted as Y⁺, is the set of all attributes that can be functionally determined from Y.

• **Process:**

• **Basis:** Start with Y⁺ = Y.

• **Induction:** Iteratively add any attribute A for which there exists an FD X → A where X is a subset of the current Y⁺.

• **Challenge:** Understanding the iterative process and applying it to test whether a set of attributes is a superkey.

3. **Armstrong’s Axioms:**

• **Components:**

• **Reflexivity:** If Y is a subset of X, then X → Y.

• **Augmentation:** If X → Y, then XZ → YZ for any Z.

• **Transitivity:** If X → Y and Y → Z, then X → Z.

• **Challenge:** Seeing how these basic rules combine to derive more complex dependency relationships.

4. **Finding All Implied FDs:**

• **Method:** For each possible set of attributes X, compute X⁺ and then list each FD of the form X → A (for each A in X⁺ but not in X).

• **Challenge:** The exponential number of attribute subsets makes the process computationally heavy, and care must be taken to avoid redundant dependencies (like XY → A when X → A already holds).

5. **Minimal Basis (Canonical Cover):**

• **Goal:** Reduce the set of FDs to a minimal, non-redundant form where:

• Every FD has a single attribute on the right.

• There are no unnecessary attributes on the left.

• **Challenge:** The iterative process of splitting, simplifying, and checking for redundancy can be conceptually difficult and requires a careful application of inference rules.

6. **Normalization:**

• **Purpose:** To decompose a database schema into smaller relations that reduce redundancy and avoid update anomalies.

• **Connection to FDs:** FDs guide the decomposition. For example, if certain FDs imply that some attributes depend on others, the schema can be split so that each relation captures a distinct dependency.

• **Challenge:** Ensuring that the decomposition remains lossless (no data is lost) and that all necessary dependencies are preserved.

This summary captures the essence of the presentation and explains the tougher concepts in simpler terms. The presentation’s emphasis is on understanding how FDs operate, how to compute closures and minimal bases, and how these concepts are essential in database normalization.
