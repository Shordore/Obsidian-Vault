Below is a comprehensive summary of the “SQL 3” presentation by Mohammad Al‑Saad, along with a breakdown of its more challenging concepts.

**Summary**

  

The presentation is divided into two main parts:

  

**1. Exam Statistics**

• **Summary Data:**

• **Mean (Average):** 86.5

• **Maximum Score:** 105

• **Median:** 89

• **Standard Deviation:** 18.2

• **Score Distribution:**

• 151 students scored between 80 and 90.

• 205 students scored between 91 and 100.

• 103 students scored between 101 and 105.

• **Skewness:**

• There is a slight left skew, indicating many high scores.

  

**2. Database Modifications in SQL**

  

The second part focuses on SQL commands that modify data in a database. Unlike SELECT queries, these commands change the data rather than returning result sets.

  

**Insertion**

• **Basic INSERT Syntax:**

• Example:

```
INSERT INTO Likes VALUES ('Sally', 'Bud');
```

  

• **Specifying Attributes:**

• Allows flexibility in the order of values and handling missing data.

• Example:

```
INSERT INTO Likes(beer, drinker) VALUES ('Bud', 'Sally');
```

  

• **Default Values:**

• In a table definition (via CREATE TABLE), attributes can have default values.

• If a value is not provided during insertion, the default is used.

• **Inserting Multiple Tuples Using a Subquery:**

• You can insert the result of a query into a table.

• Example:

```
INSERT INTO PotBuddies
  (SELECT d2.drinker
   FROM Frequents d1, Frequents d2
   WHERE d1.drinker = 'Sally'
     AND d2.drinker <> 'Sally'
     AND d1.bar = d2.bar);
```

  

  

**Deletion**

• **Basic DELETE Syntax:**

• Deletes tuples that satisfy a condition.

• Example:

```
DELETE FROM Likes
WHERE drinker = 'Sally' AND beer = 'Bud';
```

  

• **Deleting All Tuples:**

• Omitting the WHERE clause deletes every tuple.

• Example:

```
DELETE FROM Likes;
```

  

• **Complex Deletion Using Subqueries:**

• Example:

```
DELETE FROM Beers b
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT name
  FROM Beers
  WHERE manf = b.manf AND name <> b.name
);
```

  

• **Deletion Semantics:**

• Deletion is performed in two stages:

1. **Marking:** Identify all tuples that satisfy the WHERE condition.

2. **Deleting:** Remove all marked tuples.

• This ensures that dependencies between tuples do not affect the deletion process.

  

**Updates**

• **Basic UPDATE Syntax:**

• Changes values of existing tuples.

• Example:

```
UPDATE Drinkers
SET phone = '555-1212'
WHERE name = 'Fred';
```

  

• **Updating Multiple Tuples:**

• You can update several rows at once based on a condition.

• Example:

```
UPDATE Sells
SET price = 4.00
WHERE price > 4.00;
```

**Breaking Down the Hard Concepts**

1. **Subquery-Based Insertion:**

• **Concept:**

Instead of inserting a single tuple, you can insert multiple rows generated by a subquery.

• **Challenge:**

Understanding the relationship between the subquery and the main INSERT, ensuring that the subquery returns the correct data set (e.g., finding all “potential buddies” for Sally by matching bar frequents).

2. **Deletion Semantics with Subqueries:**

• **Concept:**

When using DELETE with subqueries, such as with the EXISTS clause, SQL first marks all tuples that meet the condition and then deletes them.

• **Challenge:**

Grasping the two-stage deletion process is crucial—this ensures that even if one deletion affects the subquery for another tuple, all qualifying rows are still removed.

3. **Default Values in INSERT Operations:**

• **Concept:**

Table definitions can include default values so that if an INSERT statement omits a value for an attribute, the default is automatically used.

• **Challenge:**

Remembering to specify attributes in the INSERT statement when not all values are provided, and knowing how default values interact with NULL.

4. **Updates on Multiple Tuples:**

• **Concept:**

The UPDATE command can modify one or many rows based on the WHERE clause.

• **Challenge:**

Crafting the condition correctly to ensure that only the intended tuples are updated. This becomes more complex when the update needs to target a range of values or multiple conditions.

This presentation not only reviews exam performance statistics but also delves into practical SQL modification commands. It covers the syntax and usage of INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE statements while highlighting the nuances—especially around subqueries and deletion semantics—that are often sources of confusion for learners.
