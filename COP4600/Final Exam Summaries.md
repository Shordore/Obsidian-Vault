**Module 6 Summary: Virtual Memory Concepts**

  

**1. Page Replacement Concepts** (Sources: [10], [11])

• **Effective Access Time (EAT)**: A formula combining cache hit and miss times, reflecting how quickly memory can be accessed.

• **TLB and RAM Access**: TLB hit rates and main memory access times significantly influence EAT.

• **Page Faults**:

• Occur when a page is not in memory.

• Require a page from disk to replace an in-memory page.

• **Algorithms**:

• **Optimal Replacement**: Theoretical algorithm for lowest page fault rates but not practically implementable.

• **FIFO**: Evicts the oldest page; simple but suffers from Bélády’s anomaly (page faults can increase with more frames).

• **LRU**: Evicts the least recently used page; better than FIFO but resource-intensive.

  

**2. Age-Based Algorithms** (Sources: [12], [13])

• **Not Frequently Used (NFU)**: Tracks page usage frequency and evicts least used pages.

• Remembers all past usage, which can be inefficient.

• **Aging Algorithm**: Uses reference and modified bits to approximate LRU.

• Efficient and “forgets” older access data using periodic bit resets.

• **Clock Algorithm (Second Chance)**:

• Works round-robin with reference bits.

• Pages with reference bits unset are evicted, reducing overhead.

• **Working Set**:

• Uses a time window to define active pages.

• Evicts the least active pages outside the window.

  

**3. Segmentation Concepts** (Sources: [14], [15])

• **Overview**:

• Divides processes into logical segments (e.g., text, data, heap).

• Allows independent growth and protection of segments.

• **Use Cases**:

• Sharing of code segments between processes to optimize memory usage.

• Historically prominent in 32-bit systems; deprecated in 64-bit systems in favor of paging.

• **Paging vs. Segmentation**:

• Paging is simpler for programmers as OS manages page tables.

• Segmentation requires explicit programmer control.

• **Shared Libraries**:

• Features like DLLs (Windows) and shared objects (Linux) leverage virtual memory for memory-efficient inter-process communication.

  

**4. Page Fault Handling** (Sources: [13])

• Steps:

1. Identify required page and verify its legitimacy.

2. Check access rights for the process.

3. Select a victim page for eviction using replacement algorithms.

4. Handle dirty pages by saving them to disk if modified.

5. Load new page and restore process context.

**Module 7 Summary: File System Concepts**

  

**1. File System Fundamentals** (Sources: [26], [29])

• **Purpose of File Systems**:

• Provides persistent storage for data (survives process termination and shutdown).

• Manages growing storage capacity, locates free space, and enables concurrent data access.

• Supports features like human-readable identifiers, data protection, and file type identification.

• **File Characteristics**:

• A file is logically named, persistent storage, typically a sequence of bytes.

• File types are identified via extensions (e.g., .txt, .jpg) or magic numbers (first 512 bytes of data).

• Attributes such as ownership, size, and permissions are stored in a File Control Block (FCB) or inodes in Unix-like systems.

• **File Access**:

• **Sequential Access**: Linear read/write (e.g., tapes, pipes).

• **Random Access**: Jump to specific locations in a file (e.g., HDDs, SSDs).

• **Directories**:

• Organized hierarchically, starting with the root directory.

• Can be structured as linear lists, linked lists, or more complex structures like B-trees for efficiency.

• Support operations like file linking (hard and soft links) and mounting file systems.

  

**2. File System Organization and Mounting** (Sources: [27], [30])

• **Directories**:

• Represented as hierarchical structures; contain attributes and pointers to files.

• Pathnames describe file locations and can be absolute (from root) or relative (from current directory).

• **Mounting**:

• Attaches a filesystem to a directory (mount point) to make it accessible.

• Can be manual (Unix/Linux) or automatic (Windows).

• Linux Virtual File System (VFS) abstracts filesystem details, providing a unified interface for user applications.

  

**3. Virtual File System (VFS)** (Sources: [27], [30])

• Acts as a layer between user applications and specific filesystem implementations.

• **Key Components**:

• **File Objects**: Represent open files, holding metadata and access information.

• **Dentries (Directory Entries)**: Map filenames to inodes.

• **Inodes**: Store metadata about files but not their names or content.

• **Superblocks**: Represent mounted filesystems and maintain their state.

• Supports multiple filesystem types (e.g., ext4, FAT32).

  

**4. File Allocation Methods** (Sources: [28], [31])

• **Contiguous Allocation**:

• Files stored sequentially.

• High performance but prone to fragmentation and resizing issues.

• **Linked List Allocation**:

• Blocks contain pointers to the next block.

• Allows dynamic file growth but is inefficient for random access.

• **Chained Table Allocation (FAT)**:

• Links stored in a central table for faster random access.

• **Indexed Allocation**:

• Uses an index block to track all data blocks for a file.

• Limits file size and may waste space for small files.

• **Multilevel Indexed Allocation**:

• Hierarchical index blocks allow large file sizes (e.g., Unix I-nodes).

• **Chained Indexed Allocation**:

• Combines indexing with linking for theoretically infinite file sizes but may waste space.

• **Hybrid Schemes**:

• Unix I-node system optimizes for both small and large files by combining direct, indirect, and multilevel blocks.

  

**5. Key Insights**:

• File allocation strategies vary based on access patterns (sequential vs. random) and hardware characteristics.

• Modern systems often support multiple allocation methods to optimize performance for different use cases.

  

This module provides a detailed exploration of how filesystems are structured, implemented, and optimized for storage and retrieval efficiency.

• **Avoid No Preemption**: Use two-phase locking—processes acquire all resources in one phase or release them.

• **Avoid Circular Wait**: Order resources and enforce acquisition in a predefined sequence.

  

**4. Special Cases of Deadlocks** (Sources: [92], [95])

• **Communication Deadlocks**:

• Processes waiting for messages can deadlock if buffers are full.

• **Solution**: Use timeouts or retransmission strategies.

• **Livelock**:

• Processes continuously attempt actions but make no progress.

• Appears active (“alive”) but accomplishes nothing.

• **Example**: Two-phase locking where neither process acquires all locks.

• **Solution**: Introduce randomized retries or backoff mechanisms.

• **Starvation**:

• Some processes never progress due to priority or timing issues.

• **Example**: Dining philosophers where one philosopher always gets blocked.

• **Solution**: Fair scheduling or resource ordering.

  

**Key Takeaways**:

• Deadlocks are complex and require tailored solutions based on detection, avoidance, or prevention.

• Practical strategies, such as spooling and resource ordering, mitigate risks in real-world systems.

• Special cases like livelocks and starvation highlight the need for dynamic and fair resource management.
