**Presentation 1: Memory Management** 

**Key Topics:**

1. **Memory Addressing**:

• **Physical Addressing**: Absolute memory locations accessed directly.

• **Logical Addressing**: Virtual addresses are translated by hardware and the OS into physical addresses, supporting more flexible memory allocation.

2. **Memory Protection**:

• Protects the OS and processes from each other.

• Techniques like the **fence register** and **high/low registers** are used to ensure that processes access only authorized memory.

3. **Memory Allocation**:

• Allocation strategies are essential to manage free and used memory spaces.

• Strategies include **bitmaps** and **linked lists** for tracking memory blocks, with several algorithms to find appropriate memory blocks (e.g., **First Fit**, **Best Fit**, and **Worst Fit**).

  

**Presentation 2: Memory Partitioning** 

**Key Topics:**

1. **Fixed vs. Variable Partitions**:

• **Fixed Partitions (MFP)**: Memory is divided into fixed-size partitions. Inefficient because large programs may not fit, and small programs waste memory in large partitions.

• **Variable Partitions (MVP)**: Partitions are resized as needed. More efficient but prone to **external fragmentation**.

2. **Fragmentation**:

• **External Fragmentation**: Small unusable memory fragments between partitions.

• **Internal Fragmentation**: Occurs when allocated memory is not fully utilized within a process.

3. **Compaction**:

• A method to solve external fragmentation by consolidating free memory blocks, similar to disk defragmentation.

  

**Presentation 3: Virtual Memory** 

**Key Topics:**

1. **Virtual Memory**:

• Provides an abstract memory space larger than physical memory.

• Pages or segments are swapped in and out of physical memory as needed.

2. **Paging**:

• Pages are the basic unit of memory allocation. Fixed-size pages eliminate external fragmentation but may cause internal fragmentation.

• **Page Tables**: Map virtual addresses to physical addresses using page frames.

3. **Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)**:

• A cache for frequently accessed page table entries to speed up memory access.

4. **Page Faults**:

• Occurs when a page is not in memory and must be loaded from disk. Handling page faults requires interaction with the OS.
