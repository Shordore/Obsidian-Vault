**Presentation 1: Process Synchronization** 

**Key Topics:**

1. **Synchronization Criteria**:

• **Safety**: Ensures data consistency during process interaction. Violations can lead to invalid states or corrupted data.

• **Liveness**: Ensures all processes eventually complete. Failures can cause **deadlock** (when processes wait on each other) or **starvation** (when a process waits indefinitely).

2. **Synchronization Techniques**:

• **Shadow Copies (Copy-on-Write)**: Processes read old data while writes happen in parallel. After writing is complete, the new version is swapped in.

• **Monitors**: Language-level synchronization tools using conditional variables. In Python, cv.wait() and cv.notify() manage access to critical regions, while Java uses synchronized methods.

• **Mutexes & Semaphores**: OS-provided synchronization mechanisms. Mutexes lock resources for single-thread access, and semaphores allow more complex control over multiple resources.

3. **Barriers**: Processes must all reach a certain point before any can proceed, ensuring synchronization at key stages of execution.

  

**Presentation 2: Mutual Exclusion** 

**Key Topics:**

1. **Busy Waiting**:

• **Strict Alternation**: Forces two processes to take turns in the critical region, but can lead to inefficiency if processes have varying workloads.

• **Flagging Interest**: Reduces inefficiency by allowing processes to repeatedly enter the critical region unless another process is interested. However, this can result in **deadlock** if both processes simultaneously indicate interest.

2. **Peterson’s Solution**:

• Combines alternation and flagging to avoid deadlock. Uses a shared variable turn and flags to ensure that one process yields if the other is interested.

3. **Atomic Locking**:

• **Test-and-Set-Lock (TSL)**: An atomic instruction that prevents race conditions by combining lock checking and acquisition in a single operation. Helps implement busy waiting without deadlocks.

4. **Mutex via TSL**:

• Implements a more efficient lock by yielding the CPU when a process can’t acquire the mutex, avoiding busy waiting and improving performance.

  

**Presentation 3: Synchronization Problems** 

**Key Topics:**

1. **Dining Philosophers Problem**:

• Demonstrates **circular deadlock** where each philosopher waits indefinitely for resources. Solutions involve using semaphores to ensure philosophers only acquire both chopsticks (resources) when available, avoiding deadlock.

2. **Producer-Consumer Problem**:

• Involves multiple producers and consumers interacting with a shared buffer. Naïve solutions suffer from race conditions, which can be avoided using semaphores to control access to the buffer.

• **Semaphores** ensure mutual exclusion by using critical sections and preventing race conditions where two processes attempt to access the same resource simultaneously.

3. **Readers-Writers Problem**:

• Multiple readers can access a shared resource concurrently, but only one writer can modify it at a time. Semaphores are used to manage concurrent access, ensuring that writers have exclusive access while reading is shared.
