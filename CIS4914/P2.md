Hello, I am Shahyah Darioosh and today I am excited to once again update you on the progress of AlbertAI, as always, I am joined by Gabriel Ayoubi, Sean Hershkowitz, Jacob Kantor, and Amy Wu


Our backend systems are nearly complete. The question and user systems are finished, and while our data monitoring systems are still in progress, we’re making solid headway. On the AI front, the system is set up and currently being trained. We’ve implemented a basic version on the front end, and we’re in the process of fully linking it with our question system. The front end itself is progressing well—with the student dashboard complete and the teacher dashboard actively in development.
