Good Afternoon, today, I am excited to present **_Albertai: an AI-powered study companion_** that enhances exam preparation through personalized question generation. As always I am Shahyah Darioosh, and I am joined by Gabriel Ayoubi, Sean Hershkowitz, Jacob Kantor, and Amy Wu

**Slide Change**

 we developed this project to address a common academic challenge: limited access to effective study materials.”
 
 _“Many students rely on a handful of past exams provided by professors. Unfortunately, these are often_ **_insufficient for thorough exam preparation_**_. Students need more practice questions tailored to their course content, but manually creating them is time-consuming. That’s where Albertai comes in.”_

_Our solution is a_ **_web tool_**  Using_ **_GPT-4o and the OpenAI API_**_, Albertai can generate_ **_unlimited practice questions_** _by analyzing course materials. Students receive_ **_customized quizzes_** _that help reinforce their learning, making exam prep more effective and engaging._

**Slide Change**

_Let’s talk about how Albertai works under the hood. Our system consists of four key components:”_

• **Frontend**: A **React-based UI** for easy interaction.

• **Backend**: Built on **.NET**, handling API requests and authentication.

• **Database**: A **MySQL database** to store user data and uploaded materials and the output practice questions.

• **AI Engine**: **GPT-4o** processes course content and generates relevant practice questions.

_“These components work together to deliver an intuitive and seamless experience for students.

Now I will hand it over to Jacob to show our interface designs
