**1. Overview of Cryptographic Concepts**

• **Encryption and Decryption:**

• **Encryption:** The process of converting readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using an algorithm and a key.

• **Decryption:** The reverse process, restoring ciphertext back to plaintext using the appropriate key.

• **Key Terminology:**

• **Plaintext:** The original message that is intended to be kept secret.

• **Ciphertext:** The encrypted version of the plaintext.

• **Key:** A secret value used to control the encryption and decryption process.

**2. Classical Cryptography**

  

**Caesar Cipher (Shift Cipher)**

• **Description:**

The Caesar cipher, also known as the shift cipher or ROT-x cipher, is one of the simplest forms of encryption.

• **Mechanism:**

• **Encryption:** Each letter in the plaintext is shifted right by a fixed number of positions (x).

• Formula:  c = (p + x) mod 26

• **Decryption:** Each letter in the ciphertext is shifted left by the same fixed number (x).

• Formula:  p = (c – x) mod 26

• **Breaking the Cipher:**

• **Brute-force attack:** Try all 26 possible shifts.

• **Frequency analysis:** Analyze letter frequencies in the ciphertext and compare them to typical frequency patterns in the language.

  

**Substitution Cipher (Monoalphabetic)**

• **Description:**

A substitution cipher replaces each letter of the alphabet with another letter according to a fixed permutation.

• **Key Space:**

• There are 26! possible keys (permutations), which makes brute-force less trivial compared to a simple shift cipher.

• **Cryptanalysis Techniques:**

• **Frequency analysis:** Use single letter, bigram, and trigram frequencies.

• **Pattern and Context Analysis:** Look for common patterns (e.g., repeated letters or common word structures) to deduce likely mappings.

  

**Polyalphabetic Cipher (e.g., Vigenère Cipher)**

• **Description:**

The Vigenère cipher uses a set of Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a key that repeats along the length of the message.

• **Mechanism:**

• Each letter of the key determines the shift for the corresponding letter of the plaintext.

• The key repeats as needed to match the length of the message.

• **Cryptanalysis:**

• **Periodicity analysis:** Determining the key length by looking for repeated patterns.

• **Kasiski Test:** An advanced frequency analysis method that identifies the repeated sequences and helps in estimating the key period.

**3. Secret-Key Cryptography and the One-Time Pad (OTP)**

  

**One-Time Pad (OTP)**

• **Mechanism:**

• **Encryption:** The plaintext is XORed with a pad (a secret key) that is as long as the message.

• Formula:  E(M) = M ⊕ Pad

• **Decryption:** The same pad is used to reverse the encryption.

• Formula:  D(C) = C ⊕ Pad

• **Perfect Secrecy:**

• OTP offers perfect secrecy when:

• The key is truly random.

• The key is as long as the plaintext.

• The key is used only once and then discarded.

• Both sender and receiver keep the key absolutely secret.

• **Limitations:**

• **Randomness and key distribution:** Generating, sharing, and securely storing long random keys is challenging.

• **Key reuse risks:** Reusing any part of the OTP can break its perfect secrecy.

**4. Cyberattack and Cryptanalysis Models**

  

**Types of Cryptanalysis Attacks**

• **Ciphertext-only Attack:**

The attacker has access only to the ciphertext.

• **Known-plaintext Attack:**

The attacker has pairs of plaintext and corresponding ciphertext.

• **Chosen-plaintext Attack:**

The attacker can choose plaintexts to be encrypted.

• **Chosen-ciphertext Attack:**

The attacker can choose ciphertexts and obtain their decryption.

  

**Cryptanalysis Techniques**

• **Brute-force:**

Trying all possible keys until the correct one is found.

• **Linear Cryptanalysis:**

Establishing linear relationships between plaintext, ciphertext, and key bits to reduce the key space.

• **Differential Cryptanalysis:**

Examining how differences in plaintext pairs affect differences in ciphertext pairs to extract key information.

  

**Key Size Considerations**

• **Historical Perspective:**

• **DES:** 56-bit key, once considered secure but now vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

• **3DES:** Uses three 56-bit keys (total 168-bit key), offering greater security.

• **AES:** Typically uses key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits, providing a strong level of security.

• **Exponential Growth:**

Every additional bit in the key doubles the effort required for brute-force, underscoring the importance of longer key lengths.

**5. Transition to Modern Cryptography**

  

**Block vs. Stream Ciphers**

• **Stream Ciphers:**

• Encrypt data one bit or byte at a time by combining plaintext with a pseudorandom keystream (e.g., RC4).

• Advantages include simplicity and speed for continuous data streams.

• **Block Ciphers:**

• Encrypt fixed-size blocks of plaintext (e.g., DES, AES).

• Often require padding to handle plaintext that isn’t a multiple of the block size.

  

**Principles of Symmetric Ciphers: Confusion and Diffusion**

• **Confusion:**

• Aims to make the relationship between the plaintext and ciphertext as complex as possible, usually through substitution.

• **Diffusion:**

• Aims to spread the influence of each plaintext bit over many ciphertext bits, typically via permutation.

• **Design Idea:**

• Many modern symmetric algorithms alternate between substitution (S-boxes) and permutation (P-boxes) to enhance both confusion and diffusion.

Lecture 4 explores the evolution of cryptographic techniques from the early, simple methods of classical cryptography to the foundational ideas that underpin modern cryptographic systems. Key takeaways include:

• **Classical ciphers** like the Caesar, substitution, and Vigenère ciphers illustrate basic encryption methods and the importance of key management.

• **Cryptanalysis techniques**—from brute-force to sophisticated statistical methods—demonstrate how attackers exploit weaknesses in these ciphers.

• The **one-time pad** is highlighted as a method for achieving perfect secrecy, along with its practical limitations.

• Finally, the lecture introduces the core concepts of modern symmetric cryptography, emphasizing the roles of block and stream ciphers, as well as the fundamental principles of confusion and diffusion.

  

This breakdown provides a roadmap to understanding how classical methods have shaped modern cryptographic practices and the ongoing challenges in designing secure systems.
