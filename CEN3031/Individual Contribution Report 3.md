- Worked on the final presentation.
- Worked on the final report.

Over the period of the semester I contributed second most, adding over 5,000 lines and removing over 4,000 lines in cleanup and merging.

- I was responsible for work on both the frontend and backend as the full stack developer.
- I created a registration, and login page, I made many edits, and contributions to pages, and frameworks made by my teammates such as the dashboard.
- I worked on the system initially created my Sean Hershkowitz, to initialize the backend, and link it with the database.
- Linked the backend with the frontend via API calls.
- I implemented a search bar function in the dashboard.
- I implemented the club pages, and made the club card system redirect to them.
- I leveraged the work done by Sean Hershkowitz on the recommendation system, to create a new page that calculated the write clubs for the user.
- I fixed many bugs over the course of the project ranging from small visual bugs, to massive site breaking bugs such as the dashboard not loading at all.
- I primarily looked over, and approved my teammates pull requests to make sure bad code was not pushed to main.
