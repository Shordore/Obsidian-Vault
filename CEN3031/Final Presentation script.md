**Slide 1: Title Slide**

**Speaker:** “Good morning, today we are excited to present _ClubSwamp_. Our platform is designed to enhance the student experience by simplifying club discovery and interaction at the University of Florida.”

**Slide 2: The Team**

“Before we dive into the details, let me introduce who will be speaking today:

• First we have myself, Shahyah Darioosh and I will be the first speaker.

• next, we have Sean Hershkowitz who will be the second speaker and take you through value proposition, technical debt, and stretch goals.

• finally, Cole Smith will take you through the walkthrough and the issues we faced along the project.

**Slide 3: Introduction to ClubSwamp**

“So, what is _ClubSwamp_? I know we have spoken about it a few times now, but as a quick reintroduction.  It’s a platform where students can easily discover clubs that match their interests, and club administrators can boost interaction with their members via post, and event calendars. Whenever you are looking to join a new club, _ClubSwamp_ is there to make it simple and intuitive.”

**Slide 4: Features**

“Our platform is packed with features to address the needs of both students and club administrators:

• **User authentication and authorization** ensure secure access to the site.

• A **dashboard** helps users find clubs effortlessly via a search bar, and view the ones they are currently a part of, or own themselves.

• A **profile page** lets users set their preferences, tailoring recommendations to their interests.

• A **recommendation page** matches users to clubs that align with their profile.

• Users can create clubs instantly, becoming **club admins** and having their club appear in the recommendation lists.

• Admins can also create and post **club events** to members.

• Lastly, a **calendar page** centralizes events from all joined clubs for better organization, and to enable students to decide what events they would like to attend.”


“Each feature is aimed at making club discovery and management seamless and enjoyable.”
