- The importance of software configuration management.
	There are a few important aspects of configuration management such as version control, build management, workspace management, concurrency control, and change, as well as release management. The reason these things are important is they allow a team to have greater control over a shared project, as well as streamlining the process so less clashes can occur.
- The benefits of incorporating SCM sub practices.
	SCM sub practices are smaller than the overall configuration management discussed above, however, it is still an important aspect of a project as it can help promote smooth collaboration between a group of developers.
- The risks of not setting up an SCM environment.
	If an SCM environment is not created, it can result in clashes as a version control system would not be in place to keep the repository managed, or to prevent merge conflicts. This can lead to days of downtime as merge conflicts are attempted to be resolved manually.
- What are some popular SCM tools to share with your peers?
	There are a number of SCM tools, but to name a few:
