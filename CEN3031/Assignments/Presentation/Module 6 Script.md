**Slide 1: Introduction**
“Good morning/afternoon, everyone. Today, we’re excited to introduce **ClubSwamp**, an innovative solution designed to help University of Florida students easily discover and connect with clubs. Our project was born out of a desire to solve a common problem that many students, especially freshmen, face when trying to navigate the vast number of clubs at the university.”


My Version:

Hello, my name is Shahyah Darioosh and I will be the first speaker for today's presentation. I would like to introduce our proposed website "ClubSwamp".  

 SLIDE
 
As former freshmen, we can all relate to the overwhelming feeling of going to university for the first time, and one big instigator of that is finding a good club to join. There are events where groups advertise, but there is no simple and easy digital resource to enable a student to discover prospective clubs. We have decided to fix this issue with our product.

SLIDE

Our website will enable students to create an account via their UFID and a password of their choosing. They will then be able to choose from a list of various interests, which will be taken by the system, applied to their account, and a curated list of clubs will be displayed for them to choose from. Students can then take this list of clubs and choose any that may interest them. These clubs will then be added to their profiles, and the club events will appear on a calendar displayed there as well. Clubs may also send out announcements that will appear to anyone who has added the club to their profile in order to ensure the student is kept up to date on all the most recent happenings.

SLIDE

In order to complete this we will need a disciplined and united team. First up we have me, my responsibilities for the team will be as the full stack developer, I will be working on both the UI elements, and the Back end database elements.

Next up is Sean Hershkowitz who I will let introduce himself

POTENTIAL ISSUES

What you have just heard might sound straightforward in nature, but the project will be susceptible to the same issues as most. As we are dealing with user data, we have to ensure it is private, and secure, one way we will do this is by ensuring SQL injection protection is enabled. We will also be susceptible to scope creep, as we want to make the platform the best we can, but this can lead to us stretching ourselves too thin, and thus not being able to deliver a polished, and well though out product. User adoption is another major issue as if not enough users find the website, there may not be enough interaction for the project to take off. Scalability conversely could be a problem if the product takes off far more than predicted, and the system it is built on is not capable of handling the load. We will do our best to ensure we account for these issues as we continue through the development of the project.

Thank you very much for listening to our presentation, and we hope that you all are just as excited for ClubSwamp as we are!


**Slide 2: The Team**
“Before we dive into the problem, let me quickly introduce our team:

• **Shahyah Darioosh**: Our full-stack Software Developer.

• **Sean Hershkowitz**: Our Scrum Manager and Backend Developer.

• **Cole Smith**: Product Manager and Frontend Developer.”

**Slide 3: The Problem**

“The problem we’re addressing is that it’s difficult for students to find clubs that match their interests. While clubs do host events to advertise, these are infrequent and not comprehensive. In addition, there isn’t an easy-to-use online resource that helps students discover clubs or events happening around campus.”

**Slide 4: The Idea**
“Our solution is simple and effective. **ClubSwamp** is a website where students can:


• Sign up using their UFID and create a secure password.

• Select their interests from a predefined list.

• Receive recommendations for clubs that match their interests.

• Show interest in clubs and even add club events directly to their calendars.”

**Slide 5: What’s Required**

“To make this project a reality, we’ll be using **React** with **TypeScript** for the frontend, and **.NET** with **MySQL** for the backend and database management.”

  

**Slide 6: Sprint 0 Backlog**

“In our initial sprint, **Sprint 0**, we focused on setting up the basic functionality, including:

• **User Authentication**: Assigned to Shahyah with a time estimate of 5.

• **SQL Injection Protection**: Sean is responsible for this with a time estimate of 2.

• **User Registration**: Shahyah is also working on this for 3 hours.

• **User Profile**: This feature is being developed by Cole with a time estimate of 3.”

**Slide 7: Sprint 1 Backlog**

“Moving into **Sprint 1**, we’ll focus on more advanced features, such as:

• **Interest-based Recommendations**: Handled by Sean and Shahyah, with an estimated time of 13 hours.

• **Search by Keyword**: Shahyah will spend 5 hours on this.

• **Calendar System**: Cole is assigned to build this over 8 hours.

• **Club Announcements**: A shared responsibility between Cole and Sean, with a 5-hour time estimate.”

**Slide 8: System Architecture**

“We’ve chosen to use a **monolithic architecture** for **ClubSwamp**, which simplifies development and suits our project’s scope. Key components of the system include:


• **User Management**: Handling login, registration, and profiles while ensuring security through SQL injection protection.

• **Club Pages**: Enabling users to search, pin clubs, and manage event dates.

• **Recommendation System**: Offering personalized club recommendations based on selected interests.”

  

**Slide 9: Risk Management**

  

**Presenter**:

“We’ve identified several risks in our project:

  

• **Data Security**: Protecting sensitive student information is a top priority, especially with the risk of SQL injection.

• **Scope Creep**: We are taking precautions to prevent the project from becoming more complex than planned.

• **User Adoption**: The platform’s success will hinge on student engagement, and we need to ensure the user experience is inviting.”

  

**Slide 10: User Stories**

  

**Presenter**:

“To better understand what students want from **ClubSwamp**, we developed user stories. Students expressed a desire for:

  

• Interest-based club recommendations.

• A calendar system to keep track of event times.

• A secure profile system.

• A platform where clubs can post announcements.”

  

**Slide 11: Conclusion**

  

**Presenter**:

“In conclusion, **ClubSwamp** is designed to enhance student life at UF by making it easier for them to discover and engage with clubs. We’re excited to develop this project further and look forward to launching it soon. Thank you for your attention, and we’re happy to answer any questions.”
