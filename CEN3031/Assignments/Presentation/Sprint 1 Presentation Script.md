**Slide 1: Title Slide**


Hello! Thank you for being with us today. Once again, my name is Shahyah Darioosh, and I will be the first presenter. I am excited to be giving you a update on our project, as we have made very important progress.

**SLIDE CHANGE**

Much like last time I am accompanied by my teammates Sean Hershkowitz, our scrum master, and Cole Smith, our product manager, whom you will hear from shortly.

**SLIDE CHANGE**

For sprint 1 we aimed to complete some core parts of our project such as implementing a skeleton of our frontend web pages, enabling us to flesh out the rest of our webpages much faster later on.
We also aimed to complete our user registration and login systems, which required us to not only setup the skeletons for our backend, but. to also flesh out our database schema, and link it to our .NET framework. Once that was complete we were then able to link this to our frontend system rendering a very important part of our project complete, and we will be demonstrating this feature later in this presentation.

**SLIDE CHANGE**

Now, I would like to look forward to the future, our sprint 2. We will be implementing a few more important components of our project. We will be implementing the interest-based recommendation system, which will be completed by myself, and Sean Hershkowitz. We will also be implementing the Calendar system which will appear on the user profile, which will be completed by Cole Smith. Next, we will be implementing the Search by keyword feature, which I myself will complete. Finally, we will complete the club announcement system, which will be spearheaded by Cole Smith, and Sean Hershkowitz.

To talk about this next section, I would like to turn it over to Cole.












_Thank you for being with us! Today, we’re excited to share our project update for ClubSwamp. This is our Sprint 1 presentation, and we’ll walk through our progress and challenges so far._

  

**Slide 2: The Team**

  

_First, let’s introduce our team. I’m working alongside a talented group of developers:_

  

• _Shahyah Darioosh, who is our Software Developer and works across the full stack._

• _Sean Hershkowitz, our Scrum Manager and Backend Developer._

• _And Cole Smith, our Product Manager who also focuses on frontend development._

  

_Together, we’re collaborating to bring ClubSwamp to life as a platform where UF students can easily discover and connect with clubs tailored to their interests._

  

**Slide 3: Project Update**

  

_For Sprint 1, we set out with specific goals. The main objectives were:_

  

• _Implementing a skeleton for our frontend pages._

• _Creating functional user registration and login webpages._

• _Establishing our database and integrating it with the .NET framework._

• _And finally, linking the frontend to the backend, which now supports user registration and login features._

  

_This sprint has allowed us to lay a solid foundation for the platform, and we’re well-positioned to expand on this functionality in Sprint 2._

  

**Slide 4: Technical Progress**

  

_Here’s a quick look at the tools we’re using and some technical achievements:_

  

• _For frontend development, we chose React, a flexible JavaScript library that’s perfect for our dynamic web pages._

• _On the backend, we’re using .NET Core, which has helped us establish a scalable architecture to manage clubs and users._

• _Swagger, our OpenAPI tool, allows us to document and test our API endpoints interactively._

• _We’re also implementing SHA256 for secure password hashing, which adds an extra layer of security for our users._

  

_Some key takeaways from this sprint: we’ve successfully set up secure user authentication, created a scalable backend, and resolved versioning and Git challenges, keeping our project on track._
