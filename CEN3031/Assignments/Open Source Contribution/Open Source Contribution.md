I am familiar with a multitude of frameworks and languages such as C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and React. I searched around for an open-source project I would like to use for this assignment, using various resources that aggregated good first problems. I mainly used a website called "goodfirstissues.com" which collected many different issues around GitHub and made it simple to search through many problems with a certain number of stars. I landed on a project named "Woocommerce", which is an open-source payment processing application made for businesses to easily accept payments of different varieties. The project contains over 55,000 commits, 9,300 stars, and 10.8k forks, which puts it well above the minimums listed in the assignment requirements. I found an issue for the project, where one of the menus in the iOS application would incorrectly show "Coupons" instead of "Reviews"; which was due to an error in the code making a call to the coupons menu, instead of the review menu. The project is quite old; its initial commit was made in 2011. This project is meant for end-consumers to use and is not a developer tool as it is a commercial product meant for business owners to use.

I feel some best practices for newcomers to utilize are to not be overzealous and place themselves so outside of their comfort zone that they take on an issue that they have absolutely no hope of solving. It is good to challenge yourself, but you should have some basic knowledge of the programming language before attempting to modify a real-world program. Each person will have their own set of "best practicesâ€œ; however, there are a few of which I believe most people agree on. You should always show kindness and understanding to your fellow contributors, as you would want them to do the same to you. Your pull requests should follow the same format that the rest of the project does, and many projects will even include a template for you to follow. Much like the pull requests, the code style should match the rest of the project, and many projects will have a file for newcomers to read showing what they would like the code style to be. The issue I am choosing to solve should be relatively easy to fix, and the largest issue will be reading the codebase to understand where the problem is stemming from. Due to this, I believe the issue should take me about 3 hours to fix. I am excited to work on this issue, as I believe it to be within my skill set, but also challenging me with tasks I have never performed before, such as reading, and parsing large codebases.
