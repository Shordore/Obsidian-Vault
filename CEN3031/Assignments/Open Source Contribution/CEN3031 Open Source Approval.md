The project I have picked for my submission is WooCommerce, which is an app for mobile devices that enables people to set up shops, and accept payments for their goods. The project currently has 300 stars which exceeds the minimum of 200, and has a fairly active community. The issue I found pertains to the "Coupons" section of the application where instead of properly denoting the menu as the coupon menu, it instead shows it as the "Reviews" menu. I believe this solution to be within my skillset, and I have forked the repository to allow me to work on it. I will utilize the Swift coding language to complete this task, and as I have a MacBook, I am able to install Xcode as required by the project. The project is about 7 years old, and has over 55,000 commits. The project is a commercial project, as it is meant to be used by end-users.
