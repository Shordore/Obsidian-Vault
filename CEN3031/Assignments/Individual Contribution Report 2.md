I contributed the following to the project:

- Cleaned up code structure, to ensure quicker development with less time spent being brought up to speed.
- I optimized the backend, and database to enable easier, and faster requests.
- I spent time debugging the backend, to eliminate some rare cases where proper commands, would result in failed authentication.
- Implemented user registration, and login via database and .NET.
- Made the backend calls secure with SHA256.
- Set up SwaggerUI in order to quickly test our system.
