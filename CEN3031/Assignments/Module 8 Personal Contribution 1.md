Shahyah Darioosh

For this project I have contributed in many different areas of the program, both with the code, and the supporting tasks needed.

- I created the login page
- I created the registration page
- I created a redirect page in the case that the user is not logged in
- I linked all of these to the homepage
- I created and configured the GitHub repo
- I have been the main code reviewer for the pull requests to ensure the code is clean, and functional before merging to the main branch
- I set up many of the group documents, and ensure all the documents are created on collaborative systems like google doc or sheets depending on what the assignment calls for.
