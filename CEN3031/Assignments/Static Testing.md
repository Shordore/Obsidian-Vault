Error Prone:
All of the issues in the error prone section are a stylistic issue, where curly braces are not placed where they are optional. The code works without change, but for clarity sake, we will change them to make the code easier to read.

Security:
The security issues are relating to the fact our website currently uses HTTP calls, which could be fixed with HTTPS to make the website more secure. If this was a actual product, HTTPS would definitely be used instead.

Unused Code:
This is simply a line of code that we commented out that we meant to remove but forgot to before committing. We will remove this line of deprecated code to fix this issue.
