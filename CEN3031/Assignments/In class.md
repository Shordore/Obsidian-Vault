1. Energy efficiency in multi core computing.
	The solution to this problem is not as simple as just one change, but multiple changes that together can make a big impact on the system as a whole.
	- Dynamic Power Management can enable a system such as the one I described to scale its power delivery to the task it is attempting to accomplish in real time. This would enable the system to be much more energy efficient, as it would be consuming less power in its downtime.
	- Scheduling and Load Balancing would enable the computer to better ensure it is working at its most efficient as much of the time as possible. Spreading the load over multiple different cores evenly ensures that not just one core is being bottlenecked leading to longer processing times, and wasted energy.

2. Enhancing security in Multi-Tenancy
	- Utilizing containers and virtualization we can achieve tenant isolation to ensure that individuals have dedicated environments to access.
	- Utilizing auditing and monitoring tools we can ensure unusual activity is caught early, keeping in line with privacy standards.
