Q1: What went wrong?

Due to a 64-bit floating point being converted to a 16-bit signed integer, an overflow occurred which caused a catastrophic failure in the rocket guidance, which violently pitched 90 degrees in flight, causing total destruction of the craft.

Q2: Which ACM ethics were violated?

Ethic 1.2 was violated as the harm was done via the temporary contamination of the surrounding area due to the fault in the code.

Ethic 1.5 was violated as the programmers utilized old code from a previous build, not doing the due diligence for checking possible complications of integrating an old program with new hardware.

Q3: What are some possible solutions the engineers could have done to prevent the disaster?

Many things could have been implemented to prevent this disaster such as proper testing with edge case test cases, and many quality assurance checks to ensure code compatibility, in all areas of the rocket's complex systems. Proper risk management, QA oversight, and ensuring there is enough time to properly check the code, no matter if the project is running overtime.
